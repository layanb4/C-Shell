# C-Shellüíª

This project implements a custom command-line shell in C, capable of executing both foreground and background processes, handling internal commands (cd, pwd, exit, help, and history), and maintaining a history of the last 10 commands. The shell features a prompt that displays the current working directory, supports re-running commands from history using !! and !n syntax, and gracefully handles the SIGINT signal (e.g., Ctrl+C) by displaying help instead of terminating. Built using CMake with a structured directory layout, the shell leverages key Unix system calls such as fork(), exec(), waitpid(), and chdir() to provide core shell functionalities, while ensuring proper input/output handling, background process cleanup, and robust error reporting via predefined macros.

## Prerequisites

* gcc installed
* linux machine

### Executing the program

* Enter `make` into your program terminal. Make sure you are in the correct directory!
